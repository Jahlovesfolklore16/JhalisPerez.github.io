  <P> I chose the autumn leaves of October because of All Too Well TV. When the song came out after a decade of waiting for it the short film did a number on me. The way that Taylor encaptured every element of her song made me melt into tears. “ Autumn leaves falling like pieces into place” that's what the photos I chose reminded me of. I made this project in hopes that I’d get a masterpiece but instead I got a result that looked unrecognizable to my original photo. I had to duplicate the layer so much I was surprised when I actually finished. 
  <Li> Mandala</Li>

	  <P> To make this project I used photoshop and edit transform to achieve this project. The shape I chose was a flower. I wanted to do wisteria a flower that falls from the branches of trees with its purple vibrant color. That's the kind of vibe I was going for because of the lyric “ I want to watch wisteria grow right over my feet. Cause I haven’t moved in years”- Taylor swift. That song is on the deluxe version of Folklore, it adds a great escapism plot to the story she tells on the album. Since I did it a little off center it's kind of dropping but if you let the song speak to you you would understand why it's a little droopy.  </P>
	  <li> Fantastical Beast</li>
	  <img src="VisualDesignMedia/Cathybrid.png" width="333" height="500" alt=""/>
	  <P> The animal I chose is the best pet ever: a cat, more specifically a ragdoll. I made a demon, angel, and cat. The irony am I right. The cat can fly and make people happy but it comes at a price. In order to stay happy you need to listen to Taylor Swift for the rest of your life. I looked for pegasus wings and demon horns( Taylor nation is in the horns). I had to make layers and erase what wasn’t needed to create the masterpiece Cinnabon. </P>
	  <li> What's Your Vibe</li>
	  <img src="VisualDesignMedia/Memoir thing-1.png" width="270" height="270" alt=""/>
	  <P> I made this project during Taylor Swifts Midnight Mayhem with me era. She just revealed that track 2 in her new album Midnights is called Maroon hence the background. Mirrorball is one of the songs on Folklore I relate to the most because I've never been a natural at anything. I've always had to try, try, try. I put fenty on the project because I use classy lip gloss not some beauty supply lip gloss. Using express made this project easier and more entertaining. </P>
	  <li> Pop Art Celebrity</li>
	  <img src="VisualDesignMedia/Rachel-Chinouriri_2022.png" width="317" height="317" alt=""/>
	  <P> Rachel Chinouriri is upcoming Black artist that I think deserves more recognition. Her most famous song is 'So my darling' it was popular for a short time on tik tok but thats not how I discovered her. She had showed up on my for page promoting her new single 'All I ever asked'and so I presaved it on spotify. I started listening to more of her music and decided to use this project to prompt her music by using photoshop.</P>
